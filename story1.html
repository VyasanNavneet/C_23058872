            <div class="content">
                <p>An estimated 2.8 million electric vehicles are on Indian roads today. That is twice the number of EVs in the UK and almost the same as in the US. China, India’s neighbour, has 20 million. However, the majority of the electric vehicles in India are two and three wheelers, unlike in other countries. The third largest automobile market in the world is now trying to push its population to adopt electric mobility by aiming to become an EV manufacturing hub. The country’s push to make it an EV manufacturing base will fulfil two of the major problems plaguing its growth – pollution and dependence on imports.</p>
                
                <p>Its capital, New Delhi, which has the most number of EVs per capita (13 for every 100 persons), is also the most polluted capital in the world. This shift is a microcosm of what India aims to achieve in the long term. Of the 233 thousand electric vehicles in the city, only around 8000 are private cars.</p>

                <p>Since 2015, the country has doubled its expenditure on manufacturing, which went from 14 billion to 33 billion in 2020.</p>

                <p>Experts opine that before India can dream of exporting EVs it needs to adopt EVs on its own roads. On the contrary, the government plans to replace a chunk of its automobile exports with electric vehicles. In 2016, India had exported 1.2 million passenger vehicles. This came down to 500 thousand in 2020 from 900 thousand in 2019, primarily due to the pandemic induced manufacturing crunch.</p>
                
                <p>The 30% EV penetration target by 2030 is incumbent upon the country improving its domestic infrastructure. To that effect, it has already faced its first jolt. Tesla, the American EV giant, has reportedly backtracked from its plans to manufacture in India. In 2023, India overtook China to become the biggest market for electric two-wheelers globally, the major structural change required is increased charging infrastructure. The country currently has 200 EVs for each charging station, compared to 20 in the US and 10 in China.</p>

                <p>“Currently, Tesla does not offer any models in the $25,000 price range, which would be more suitable for Indian consumers. However, it is considering using India as a manufacturing hub to supply left-hand drive cars to markets like Japan, Thailand, the UK, Australia, and Indonesia,” says Neil Shah, founder of Counterpoint Research. Shah worked with the government of India in its EV manufacturing plan.</p>
                
                <p>There are currently 17 companies manufacturing electric vehicles in India. Of them, TATA Motors, which dominates the Indian EV market with 74% penetration, is the most profitable, registering $15 billion in revenue.</p>
                
                <p>The average budget to buy a car in an Indian household is approximately 5,500 GBP. This is lower than the price of the most popular EV in the country - TATA Tiago, which costs around 7000 GBP. This is said to be one of the reasons that Tesla is taking it slow in India. “By the end of the first half of 2024, passenger cars priced above $24,000 account for only 8% of India's passenger car market, but this share could grow to 15% by 2030,” says Shah.</p>
                
                <p>Lizbeth Godwin, Senior Research Associate, Centre for Public Policy Research, says the incentives offered by state governments are key here. Delhi, for instance, waives off Road Tax and Registration Fee if one buys an EV registered in the state. “The EV policies formulated by various states have led to a rise in the number of EV sales. But in order to facilitate the acquisition process, insurance costs for these vehicles must be addressed. The lack of a standardised second-hand market also contributes to the perception of risk, as financiers struggle to assess the residual value of the asset in the event of loan default,” says Godwin.</p>
                
                <p>Delhi is home to the third largest e-bus fleet in the world. Godwin says auto manufacturers have moved toward producing e-autos instead of passenger vehicles. These companies include Italian motor vehicles manufacturer Piaggio. “The maintenance cost of 3 wheeler EVs is found to be 80% less than that of ICE vehicles.”</p>
                
                <p>Gowdin argues more electric vehicles on the road should not be the final goal. “Our ultimate aim should be reducing cars on roads rather than providing a scope for 'clean congestion'. The focus should be on nudging people to use more public transport.”</p>
