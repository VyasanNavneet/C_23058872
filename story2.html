            <div class="content">
                <p>India’s exports of integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors, which are seen as the fundamental building blocks for high-tech semiconductors, haven’t stopped growing over the last five years. The country exported close to four billion dollars’ worth of integrated circuits last year. This has allowed it to surpass the exports of Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, legacy powers in Asian tech exports.</p>

                <p>India’s semiconductor industry was valued at $32 billion in 2023. Its manufacturing currently caters to the domestic market. Samsung, to which it supplies 14% of its high-end chips, is its key customer.</p>

                <p>India’s presence in the industry was mostly restricted to manufacturing segments of the semiconductors, which then have to be brought together with precision. Now, India plans to become an end-to-end manufacturer. In a span of 10 years, global players like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), Applied Materials and Micron Technology have established their presence in the country after the Indian government started opening up to concessions and investment support.</p>

                <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/18635351"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/18635351/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

                <p>India is trying to capitalise this situation to pioneer the execution of 2 nm technology (to manufacture the most advanced generation of chips). For this, it needs semiconductor fabrication plants, the backbone of high-end manufacturing.</p>

                <p>Taiwan has a monopoly in manufacturing these specialized chips with a 60% market share. The companies spearheading this, TSMC and PSMC (Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation), are expanding their manufacturing bases by building factories in India. These investments are built upon India’s progress in exporting integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors.</p>

                <p>Another player, Foxconn is keen to expand its current iPhone manufacturing facility in the state of Tamil Nadu into a semiconductor manufacturing plant. Its financial reports of the past three years showed that it has steadily increased its investment in India and generated $100 million in revenue in 2022.</p>

                <p>Despite this, Micron Technology, the American giant, seems to be winning the race. This is also because it has been partially banned in China, forcing it to look at India more seriously. It is pushing for a quicker way to manufacture semiconductors by the end of this year and gain a lion’s share of the Indian market.</p>

                <p>Neil Shah, of Counterpoint Research, which analyses India’s EV and semiconductor market, says “Micron’s planned facility would address the demand for domestic and international markets. But it will depend on how consistent the Indian government is with the policies and schemes”.</p>

                <p>The government seems to support Taiwanese companies more than the American ones as they are already in a position to scale up their India operations.</p>

                <p>As these companies jostle for space, smaller companies are courting the Indian market to set up their own manufacturing units. Andy G Sellars of CSA Catapult, who led the UK delegation in July this year to discuss the India-UK technology corridor, says India’s tech landscape and massive workforce can provide an alternative to China if the government continues to invest in these resources. “The sheer size and the workforce of the country gives it an edge over others,” he says.</p>

                <p>Sellars, who met Priyank Kharge, Minister for Information Technology and Bio Technology in Karnataka, home to the Bangalore IT hub, says the presence of credible native companies as partners adds to India’s advantage. “A company like TATA allows foreign companies to be confident about India. It is a massive company and has credibility”, he says.</p>

                <p>“You need companies that get work done on such a large scale”.</p>

                <p>“The unique thing about China was that they took a very long-term view of investments,” says Sellars, “They work on a 50-year time horizon. India is at a position now where it can think long term”.</p>

                <p>He is referring to the TATA-PSMC plant in Dholera, Gujarat. TSMC, the other Taiwanese giant, is looking to collaborate with TATA in its Assam plant. Its Taiwanese factory is regarded as the most sophisticated manufacturing facility in the world, a site where Nvidia and Apple were responsible for a third of its revenue in the last five years.</p>

                <p>Shah believes that to become a manufacturing hub, India needs to perfect perhaps the most complex manufacturing activity in the world.</p>

                <p>He says that the interest of TSMC, Micron and PSMC has forced other companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom Inc to show interest in India.</p>

                <p>“It is now fully on the Indian government to live up to the hype it has created,” he says.</p>
