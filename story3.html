            <h1>Fearful of Local Unions, Foxconn's Sriperumbudur Plant Recruits Workers from Remote Villages</h1>
            
            <div class="content">
                <p>Foxconn, the Taiwanese semiconductor giant, is reportedly going out of its way to hire employees from towns as far away from its manufacturing plant as possible. This is to avoid any altercations with local labour unions. Its Sriperumbudur plant, the largest outside China, is surrounded by manufacturing plants owned by Samsung, TATA and Yamaha among other local ones. Naturally, there is a presence of powerful unions which oversee the working conditions of much of the local workforce.</p>

                <p>"I feel as if I am transported into a much better world. One where technology is all around. I like being here, I always felt like a young person should be around technology," says Lata (name changed), who is driven into the plant every day from Palur, 29kms from the location. She was offered the job after being approached by a hiring agent. The cost of travel, accommodation and food is handled by the company.</p>

                    <img src="foxconn.png" alt="Transition image 3">
                </div>

                <p>"My previous job required me to work in a much more shanty building in the heat. The conditions are much better here," says the employee who was previously in textile manufacturing.</p>

                <p>From the outset, this does seem to be a favourable turn of events. However, Foxconn has different reasons for this.</p>

                <p>Satish Paul, a former HR manager at the company, says that the company tries to avoid any engagement with unions. Natives of Sriperumbudur are part of some or the other union, this worries the company. "If something goes wrong, they are not prepared to handle it." Wistron, a competitor, had its Bangalore factory vandalised by its employees and members of a local labour union after it failed to pay the agreed wage.</p>

                <p>In March 2024, a Reuters investigation revealed that the company has systematically filtered out married women. This unsaid hiring rule, many believe, was to ensure that there is no situation in which women opt for maternity leave which the company believes will affect its productivity.</p>

                <p>The only way to mitigate the risk caused by this revelation is to employ people from far away. "Mobilise" is the word Paul used in his conversation with us. "The company tries to avoid upsetting a community which can then mobilise the unions and other members of its community." This, he believes, can bring the company's production to a standstill.</p>

                <p>The company employees 17,000 people and is responsible for producing a significant chunk of India-made iPhones. The current salary of 15,000 INR (GBP 150) per month for assembly workers including lodging and travel offers a much better standard of living for them. The role of Logistics Supervisor, which includes much of its labour force, is paid 400,000 INR (GBP 400) pa.</p>

                <p>This seems to be the learning from what happened at a Wistron factory in 2020 when its workers staged a protest for being paid 20 GBP less that what was promised in the monthly wages contract.</p>
