                <p>Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant, is going out of its way to hire employees from towns far from its manufacturing plant to avoid potential altercations with local labour unions. Its Sriperumbudur factory, surrounded by other manufacturing plants owned by Samsung, TATA, Yamaha, and local companies, faces the challenge of powerful unions overseeing the local workforce. This comes as the company expands operations to manufacture advanced semiconductors and iPhones.</p>
                
                <p>Lata (name changed), 26, is driven to the plant five days a week from Palur, 29 kilometers away. “I feel as if I am transported into a much better world. One where technology is all around. I like being here,” she says. She was offered the job after being approached by a hiring agent in a WhatsApp group. The company covers her travel, accommodation, and food expenses.</p>
                
                <p>“My previous job required me to work in a much more shanty building in the heat. The conditions are much better here,” says Lata, who was previously employed in textile manufacturing.</p>
                
                <p>While this seems like a favorable turn of events for one worker, a former HR manager at the company revealed that this is part of a broader strategy.</p>
                
                <p>Satish Paul, a former Foxconn HR manager at the Sriperumbudur factory, explains that the company is eliminating potential disruptions to its expansion plans, particularly from local labour unions. Many locals, employed in the town’s manufacturing plants, are part of these unions. “If something goes wrong, they are not prepared to handle it,” says Paul, pointing to a recent incident involving Wistron, a competitor. Wistron's Bangalore factory was vandalized by employees and union members after it failed to pay the agreed-upon wage, underpaying by 20 GBP per month.</p>
                
                <p>In March, a Reuters investigation revealed that Foxconn’s Sriperumbudur factory had systematically rejected married women in its hiring process. The report suggested that this unsaid rule was to ensure that women would not take maternity leave, which the company believes could affect productivity.</p>

                <p>Paul confirms that this looks like another measure by the company to mitigate the risk of productivity stalling. “The company tries to avoid upsetting any community that could mobilize unions and stage protests,” he explains. Such mobilization, he believes, could bring production to a standstill.</p>
                
                <p>The company employs 17,000 people at its Sriperumbudur plant, producing a significant portion of India-made iPhones. The monthly salary of 15,000 INR (GBP 150) for assembly workers, including lodging and travel, provides a better standard of living compared to other jobs.</p>
                
                <p>Babita Kumari, an expert in corporate labour law, notes that this strategy is not new. “Many companies try to avoid local labour unions, viewing them as potential disruptors to business operations due to strikes and demands that can increase costs. Unions can indeed disrupt production, particularly when negotiations break down or when they are influenced by political agendas. This is especially common in sectors like manufacturing and transport.”</p>
                
                <p>Labour unions fear that Indian workers may be exploited similarly to those in China. Estimating the salaries of these workers is difficult, as most are hired on contract. Paul mentions that while the salary in 2000 was 180,000 rupees annually, it is now around 204,000 rupees—below Tamil Nadu’s per capita income and only slightly above the state’s minimum wage. In comparison, China’s long history of manufacturing has resulted in significantly higher wages.</p>
                
                <p>Foxconn chairman, Terry Gou, who was in India on August 17th to inaugurate a new 18,000-capacity hostel complex near the plant, declined to answer questions from journalists. Kumari argues that the government fails to enforce labour regulations. “In contrast, the corporate sector, with its skilled workforce and stricter regulatory scrutiny, tends to adhere better to labor standards and provides stronger legal protections for employees.”</p>
                
                <p>The company has not responded to requests for clarification on its hiring process.</p>
