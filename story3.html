                <p>Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant, is going out of its way to hire employees from towns as far away from its manufacturing plant as possible. This is to avoid any altercations with local labour unions. Its Sriperumbudur plant is surrounded by manufacturing plants owned by Samsung, TATA and Yamaha among other local ones. There is a presence of powerful unions which oversee the working conditions of most of the locally employed workforce. This is happening at a time when the company is planning to scale up its operations by manufacturing advanced semiconductors and iPhone Pro models.</p>

                <p>Lata (name changed), is driven into the plant five days a week from Palur, 29kms from the location. “I feel as if I am transported into a much better world. One where technology is all around. I like being here; a young person should be around technology.” She was offered the job after being approached by a hiring agent in a WhatsApp group. The cost of travel, accommodation and food is handled by the company.</p>

                <p>“My previous job required me to work in a much more shanty building in the heat. The conditions are much better here,” says the employee who was previously employed in textile manufacturing.</p>

                <p>From the outset, this does seem to be a favorable turn of events for her. However, a former employee revealed that this is part of a larger ploy.</p>

                <p>Satish Paul, former Foxconn HR manager, says that the company is vigorously expediting its plans to scale up its manufacturing capacity by eliminating any possible disruption. The major one being local labour unions. Natives of Sriperumbudur, mostly employed by manufacturing plants in the town, are part of some or the other union. Hiring from this workforce worries the company. “If something goes wrong, they are not prepared to handle it.” This seems to be a learning from a recent case involving Wistron, its competitor. The company had its Bangalore factory vandalized by its employees and members of local labour unions after it failed to pay the agreed-upon wage. The employees were paid 20 GBP less than what was promised in the monthly contract.</p>

                <p>In March 2024, a Reuters investigation revealed that Foxconn has systematically filtered out married women. This unsaid hiring rule, the report said, was to ensure that women do not opt for maternity leave which the company believes will affect its productivity.</p>

                <p>On being asked if this is another one of the company’s measures to mitigate the risk of productivity stalling, Paul responded in the affirmative. “Mobilise” is the word Paul used in his conversation with us. “The company tries to avoid upsetting any community which can mobilise the unions and stage protests.” This, he believes, can bring the company’s production to a standstill.</p>

                <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/19122145"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/19122145/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

                <p>The company employs 17,000 people and is responsible for producing a significant chunk of India-made iPhones. The current salary of 15,000 INR (GBP 150) per month for assembly workers including lodging and travel provides a much better standard of living for them.</p>

                <p>Babita Kumari, who works in corporate labour law, says this is not a new phenomenon. “Many companies try to avoid local labour unions, viewing them as potential disruptors to business operations due to strikes and demands that can increase costs. Unions can indeed disrupt production, particularly when negotiations break down or when they are influenced by political agendas. This is especially common in sectors like manufacturing and transport.”</p>

                <p>Labour Unions fear a situation where Indian workers are exploited in the same way as in China. It is harder to estimate the salary of these workers for they are mostly hired on contract. But Paul says the salary in 2000 was 180,000 rupees and is around 204,000 rupees. This is below the state Tamil Nadu’s per capita and slightly more than the minimum wage in the state. In comparison, China’s long history of manufacturing has ensured that the pay is staggeringly above that of India.</p>

                <p>Foxconn chairman, who was in India to inaugurate a new 18,000 capacity hostel complex in the vicinity of the plant, refused to take questions post a public event. Rajput says there is certainly a lack of interest on the part of the government to enforce strict regulations. Why this is can be subject to conjecture. “In contrast, the corporate sector, with its skilled workforce and stricter regulatory scrutiny, tends to adhere better to labor standards and provides stronger legal protections for employees.”</p>

                <p>The company has not responded to requests inquiring clarification on its hiring process.</p>
